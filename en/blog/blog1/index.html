            <br>
            Everyone wants to install mods on ubuntu and play minecraft, right?<br>
            But I think that there is a point where it gets caught a little, so I would like to write a little about how to deal with it.<br>
            Note: I'm beginner to Linux. Please self-responsibility.<br>
            <br>
            Up to the point of downloading Forge's jar, there is no problem normally.<br>
            But I get this error when I try to run the downloaded file.<br>
            <img src="Screenshot from 2022-12-26 03-00-08.png"/><br>
            This error can be resolved by marking the forge jar as executable.<br>
            However, it is not possible in such a GUI environment, so we will use the CUI environment.<br>
            <br>
            Use the chmod command to change permissions and marks.<br>
            By the way, the mark before mark operation is like this.<br>
            -rw-rw-r--<br>
            â†‘x flag is not exist!!! (not marked as executable)<br>
            <br>
            Here is the command to resolve the error (mark it as executable).<br>
            chmod +x (File Name)<br>
            It's just a command that is marked as executable with "+x".<br>
            <br>
            By doing this, you can run the Forge installer normally<br>
